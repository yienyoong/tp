## Introduction

Welcome to Vax@NUS! 

Vax@NUS is a **one stop management app to efficiently track and schedule COVID-19 vaccinations for NUS students.** 
It allows UHC staff to enter profiles of NUS students into the app, create and schedule vaccination appointments for students, and update their details with just a few simple commands.
Staff can also use the statistic function to view at a glance, the vaccination rates of students, and the number of appointments booked for the upcoming week.

It is a desktop app **optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, Vax@NUS can get your appointment management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Read on to find out how you can use Vax@NUS.

### Appointment Management Features

#### Adding an appointment: `addAppt`

The current version of Vax@NUS allows no more than one appointment scheduled for each student. You thus will not be able to add a new appointment for a student if they already have one.

1. Enter `addAppt A1234567X d/2021-12-13 ts/13:00` into the command box to add an appointment for John Doe.

  the matriculation number or appointment is not found.

## FAQ

**Q**: What do I do if I accidentally delete a student? 
<br>
**A**: Unfortunately, the deletion is permanent. You will have to manually re-add the student.

**Q**: What can be included in medical details?
<br>
**A**: Allergies and past medical history.

**Q** : Am I able to reassign an appointment to another student?
<br>
**A** : No, you will need to add a new appointment for the new student. 

**Q**: Why are vaccinated students able to receive new appointments?
<br>
**A**: A student can schedule a new appointment should they experience severe side effects due to the vaccination. Moreover, booster shots could be required in the future to prolong immunity and provide protection against fast-emerging COVID-19 variants. 

**Q**: How long is a vaccination appointment?
<br>
**A**: Each vaccination appointment lasts 30 minutes, which includes registration, administering the vaccine and observation. 

**Q**: Why is matriculation number used to identify an appointment? <br>
**A**: This ensures that there are no duplicate appointments, and that appointments can only be made for NUS students.
        However, we recognise the limitations, and are working on an update where appointments are identified by a unique ID instead of matriculation number.
